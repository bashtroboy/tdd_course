- Using the Rspec framework, www.rspec.info

RSPEC is used to run SPEC files.

- Install rspec
    $ gem install rspec

- Check version to ensure installation success
    $ rspec -v

- Create a new spec file
    $ touch hello_spec.rb

- Run rspec files
    $ rspec filename_spec.rb

- How to reference a file containing the class you're creating a spec framework
    require_relative 'class_name'

- Basic RSpec file structure

    RSpec.describe Hello do
    
        it "should..." do
            # code
            # code
            expect(___).to _____
        end
        
    end

- Context methods are an alias of describe methods, and can be useful for describing contextual differences in the spec that make it easier to read

    context "test that word is a palindrome" do
        it "should read the same forwards as backwards" do
            test_word = "Madam"
            result = Word.palindrome? test_word
            expect(result).to be_truthy
        end
    end

- Subjects are special variables that refer to the object being tested
